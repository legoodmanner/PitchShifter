# Pitch Shifter
## Matthieu Cachera, Seulgi Kim, Yueh-Kao Wu

We implement a frequency modifier algorithm from scratch using the phase vocoder techniques.

### How to run our code?
- If you want to shift the pitch of constant 'ah' sound, run:
```bash
sh constant_ah_sound.sh
```

- Else If you want to shift the pitch of '01-D_AMariena' sound, run:
```bash
sh amariena_sound.sh
```

- Else If you want to shift the pitch of '24-M1_Amariena-Martinete' sound, run:
```bash
sh martinete_sound.sh
```
